# What Quantum Computing Breaks in Cryptography

## TL;DR

| Crypto Type | Status | Action Required |
|-------------|--------|-----------------|
| **Asymmetric crypto (signatures)** | BROKEN | Needs PQC replacement |
| **Symmetric crypto & hashes** | SAFE | Double key sizes (e.g., AES-128 → AES-256) |

## 1. How Ethereum Identity Works

On Ethereum, your identity is represented in two ways:

1. **Public Key**: The raw coordinates on the secp256k1 elliptic curve
2. **Address**: The last 20 bytes of the Keccak-256 hash of your public key

In ECDSA, your Public Key (`Q`) is generated by multiplying your Private Key (`d`) by a Generator point (`G`):

```
Q = d × G
```

## 2. How Ethereum Signs Transactions

```
┌─────────────┐     Private Key      ┌─────────────┐
│   Wallet    │ ──────────────────▶ │   ECDSA     │ ──────▶ Signature
│   (You)     │                      │   Signing   │
└─────────────┘                      └─────────────┘
       │                                                        │
       │   Address = Hash(Public Key)                           │
       ▼                                                        ▼
   0x1234...                                   Verified by network
```

**ECDSA Security relies on:**

- Everyone can verify signatures using your public key
- Nobody can extract your private key from public signatures

This security depends on the **Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP)**

## 3. Quantum Threats to Cryptography

### Classical vs Quantum Attack

**Classical Computer** (your laptop, Ethereum nodes):
```
Brute force to find private key:
- Attempts needed: ~2^256
- Time required: billions of years with all computing power on Earth
```

### The Two Quantum Algorithms That Matter

#### 3.1 Shor's Algorithm (CRITICAL THREAT)

**What it breaks:** Anything based on discrete logarithm or integer factoring

**Analogy:** Your private key is a secret recipe; the public key is a photo of the finished cake. Today, reverse-engineering the recipe from the photo is impossible. Shor's algorithm is like a quantum chef that can instantly deduce the exact recipe just by looking at the photo.

**Impact on Ethereum:**
- ECDSA signatures use the secp256k1 curve, which relies on the discrete log problem
- When you send a transaction, your public key is revealed
- A quantum attacker could: See public key → Run Shor's → Extract private key → Steal funds

#### 3.2 Grover's Algorithm (MODERATE THREAT)

**What it does:** Provides quadratic speedup for brute-force searches

**Impact:**
- Reduces n-bit security to n/2 bits (square root speedup)
- Keccak-256: 256-bit → 128-bit security (still very strong)
- SHA-256: 256-bit → 128-bit security (still very strong)

**Mitigation:** Simply double key/hash sizes (e.g., use SHA-512 or AES-256)

## 4. What Actually Breaks in Ethereum

| Ethereum Component | Risk Level | Explanation |
|--------------------|------------|-------------|
| **Account private keys** | CRITICAL | ECDSA vulnerable to Shor's algorithm |
| **Transaction signing** | CRITICAL | Uses ECDSA (same vulnerability) |
| **Keccak-256 hashing** | SAFE | Grover reduces 256-bit → 128-bit security (still strong) |
| **Block hashing / PoS** | SAFE | Hash-based, unaffected by Shor's |
| **Merkle trees** | SAFE | Hash-based, unaffected by Shor's |

## 5. Understanding the Math: Discrete Logarithm vs Factoring

Shor's algorithm breaks two types of mathematical problems:

### 5.1 Integer Factoring (RSA)

```
p × q = N

Where:
- p, q = two large prime numbers (secret)
- N = their product (public)
```

**The hard problem:** Given only `N`, find `p` and `q`

**Used by:** RSA encryption (banking, TLS, legacy systems)

### 5.2 Discrete Logarithm (Ethereum/ECC)

In regular math:
```
2^x = 8  →  x = 3 (this is a logarithm)
```

In elliptic curve cryptography (secp256k1):
```
d × G = Q

Where:
- G = Generator point (fixed, public)
- d = Private key (secret scalar)
- Q = Public key (point on curve)
```

**The hard problem:** Given `G` and `Q`, find `d`

**Why it's hard:** On an elliptic curve, "multiplication" means repeatedly adding a point to itself, jumping around the curve. Finding how many jumps (`d`) produced `Q` is the Discrete Logarithm Problem.

| Attacker | Approach | Result |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Classical computer | Try each possible `d` one by one | Takes billions of years |
| Quantum computer (Shor's) | Uses quantum interference to find the period/pattern | Solves in hours/days |
